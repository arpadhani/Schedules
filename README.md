# Schedules
Schedules was originally created to help those studying for the GMAT using the Magoosh schedule keep track of their studies. This has been updated to become more generic and include other schedules and subjects for test prep. 

# Getting Started
git clone https://github.com/arpadhani/Schedules.git

# Contributing
Please feel free to help out with this project! It's definitely great if you want a template to build your own study schedule and want specific features that you can't find off the shelf. Best of luck - standardized exams will never be fun!
